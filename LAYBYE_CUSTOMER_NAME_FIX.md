# Laybye Customer Name Display Fix

## 🐛 The Problem

Customer names were showing as "Unknown Customer" in the laybye listing page in the admin section, even though customer IDs were present in the laybye orders.

**Example of the issue:**
- Order: `ORD-1756412092096-GJ7HS0`
- Customer ID: `aab8598e-516f-4086-ab31-82bcc0482a52` (exists)
- Display: "Unknown Customer" ❌

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the customer data fetching and matching logic in the `getLaybyeOrders` function:

1. **Batch Fetch Issue**: Customers were being fetched in a batch using `.in('id', customerIds)`, but some customers were not being found
2. **No Fallback**: When customers weren't found in the batch fetch, there was no fallback mechanism
3. **Type Mismatch**: Potential UUID/string type mismatches between customer IDs

## 🛠️ The Fix

### 1. **Enhanced Customer Fetching Logic**

**Before:**
```typescript
// Only batch fetch, no fallback
const customer = customers.find(c => c.id === order.customer_id)
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Try batch fetch first, then individual fetch as fallback
let customer = customers.find(c => c.id === order.customer_id)

if (!customer && order.customer_id) {
  // Individual fetch as fallback
  const { data: individualCustomer } = await supabase
    .from('customers')
    .select('id, first_name, last_name, email, phone')
    .eq('id', order.customer_id)
    .single()
  
  if (individualCustomer) {
    customer = individualCustomer
  }
}
```

### 2. **Improved Debugging**

Added comprehensive debugging to track:
- Customer ID types and values
- Batch fetch results
- Individual fetch attempts
- Final customer display names

### 3. **Better Error Handling**

- Graceful handling of individual customer fetch failures
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- Fallback to "Unknown Customer" only when all attempts fail

## 📊 Technical Details

### Customer Display Name Logic

The system uses a fallback hierarchy for customer names:

1. **First Name + Last Name** (if both exist)
2. **First Name only** (if last name is empty)
3. **Last Name only** (if first name is empty)
4. **Email** (if no names)
5. **Phone** (if no email)
6. **"Unknown Customer"** (if no identifying data)

### Data Flow

1. **Fetch laybye orders** with customer IDs
2. **Batch fetch customers** using customer IDs
3. **For each order**: Try to find customer in batch results
4. **If not found**: Fetch customer individually
5. **Build display name** using fallback hierarchy
6. **Return enriched data** with customer information

## 🎯 Expected Results

### After the Fix:
- ✅ Customer names display correctly
- ✅ Fallback mechanism handles edge cases
- ✅ Better error handling and debugging
- ✅ No performance impact (individual fetches only when needed)

### Example Output:
- Order: `ORD-1756412092096-GJ7HS0`
- Customer: `John Doe` ✅ (instead of "Unknown Customer")
- Phone: `+1234567890`
- Email: `john@example.com`

## 🔧 Testing the Fix

1. **Check the browser console** for debugging information
2. **Verify customer names** appear correctly in laybye listings
3. **Test with various customer data** (names, email only, phone only)
4. **Monitor performance** to ensure no degradation

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Individual fetches are rare**: Only happen when batch fetch fails
2. **No breaking changes**: Existing functionality preserved
3. **Backward compatible**: Works with existing customer data
4. **Debugging can be removed**: Once confirmed working, debug logs can be cleaned up

## 📞 Support

If customer names still show as "Unknown":

1. Check browser console for debug information
2. Verify customer exists in database
3. Check customer has identifying data (name, email, or phone)
4. Ensure customer ID in laybye order is valid

The fix ensures robust customer name display with multiple fallback mechanisms.
