## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Variant Handling
- **Same SKU**: All variants of a product must have the same main `sku`
- **Unique Variant SKUs**: Each variant must have a unique `variant_sku`
- **Stock Management**: For products with variants, set main `stock_quantity` to 0
- **Variant Options**: Use size, color, gender, brand, style fields for variant options

### Data Validation
- **Required Fields**: name, sku, price are mandatory
- **Numeric Fields**: price, cost_price, stock_quantity must be numbers
- **Boolean Fields**: is_active, is_discount_active, has_variants must be true/false
- **Date Format**: Use YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS for expiration dates

### Error Handling
- **Validation Errors**: Must be fixed before import
- **Warnings**: Can be ignored but should be reviewed
- **Duplicate SKUs**: Will be skipped in "add" mode, updated in "update" mode

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Invalid CSV format"**
   - Check that your file is saved as CSV
   - Ensure all rows have the same number of columns
   - Use quotes around text fields with commas

2. **"Required field missing"**
   - Ensure name, sku, and price are filled for all products
   - Check for empty cells in required fields

3. **"Variant SKU required"**
   - For products with `has_variants=true`, fill in `variant_sku`
   - Each variant needs a unique variant SKU

4. **"Invalid date format"**
   - Use format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS
   - Example: 2024-12-31T23:59:59

5. **"Category not found"**
   - Categories will be auto-created if they don't exist
   - Use consistent category names

### Best Practices

1. **Test with Small Files**: Start with a few products to test the format
2. **Backup First**: Export existing products before large imports
3. **Use Template**: Always start with the downloaded template
4. **Validate First**: Always validate before importing
5. **Check Results**: Review import results for any issues
