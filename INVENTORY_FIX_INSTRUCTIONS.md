# 🚨 URGENT: Inventory Management Fix Instructions

## Problem Identified
The POS system is not deducting product quantities when sales are made. This is a critical issue that affects inventory accuracy.

## Root Cause
The database trigger `update_stock_on_sale_item` that should automatically update product stock when sale items are inserted is either:
1. Not properly configured
2. Missing entirely
3. Has errors in the trigger function

## Solution
I've created a comprehensive fix that addresses all potential issues.

## 🔧 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Step 1: Apply the Database Fix
1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**
2. **Navigate to SQL Editor**
3. **Copy and paste the entire contents of `comprehensive-inventory-fix.sql`**
4. **Execute the SQL**

### Step 2: Verify the Fix
After applying the SQL fix, run the test script:
```bash
node test-inventory-fix.js
```

## 📋 What the Fix Does

### 1. **Recreates the Trigger Function**
- `update_product_stock()` - Automatically deducts stock when sale items are inserted
- `restore_product_stock()` - Restores stock when refund items are inserted

### 2. **Recreates the Triggers**
- `update_stock_on_sale_item` - Fires when sale items are inserted
- `restore_stock_on_refund_item` - Fires when refund items are inserted

### 3. **Enhances the Manual Update Function**
- `update_product_quantities()` - For manual stock updates with better error handling

### 4. **Supports Both Systems**
- **Main product stock** (products table)
- **Branch-specific stock** (branch_stock table) if it exists
- **Product variants** (product_variants table)

## 🎯 Key Features of the Fix

### ✅ **Automatic Stock Deduction**
- When a sale is made through POS, product quantities are automatically reduced
- Works with both regular sales and split payment sales
- Supports product variants

### ✅ **Branch-Specific Inventory**
- Updates branch_stock table if it exists
- Falls back to main product stock if branch stock not found
- Maintains separate inventory per branch

### ✅ **Refund Support**
- Automatically restores stock when items are refunded
- Works with both main stock and branch stock

### ✅ **Error Handling**
- Comprehensive error logging
- Graceful handling of missing records
- Detailed success/failure reporting

### ✅ **Debugging Support**
- Extensive logging with emojis for easy identification
- Shows before/after stock quantities
- Tracks all inventory changes

## 🔍 Verification Steps

After applying the fix, you should see:

1. **In Supabase Logs:**
   ```
   🔧 Trigger update_product_stock executed for product_id: xxx, quantity: 1
   ✅ Updated main product stock: product_id=xxx, old_stock=10, new_stock=9
   ```

2. **In Product Stock:**
   - Stock quantities should decrease when sales are made
   - Stock quantities should increase when refunds are processed

3. **In Test Results:**
   ```
   🎉 SUCCESS! Inventory management is working correctly.
   Product quantities are now being deducted when sales are made.
   ```

## 🚨 If the Fix Doesn't Work

If the test still fails after applying the fix:

1. **Check Supabase Logs** for any error messages
2. **Verify the triggers exist** by running the verification queries in the SQL
3. **Check RLS Policies** - ensure the service role has proper permissions
4. **Contact Support** with the error messages
